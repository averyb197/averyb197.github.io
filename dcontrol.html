                    This is a very brief guide for securing your data. This is not intended to be all inclusive, it is only to get you started down the right path. I write this out myself instead of linking to another guide like I have for other things because ALL mainstream privacy guides are really just advertisements for products which is why they always leave out the following: data centralization is the problem. Why would they leave this out? Well because those services they provide affiliate links for depend on collecting large amounts of your personal information for their services. In doing this, they ignore the golden rule of cybersecurity: no security is perfect so keep things separate. This mass collection means that when (not if) your data is leaked, it will cause much more harm than if they did not aggregate (collect and store) data that they don't need for their services. This unnecessary data is then typically sold to either <a href="assets/files/USA-06.pdf" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Facebook</a>&nbsp;or Google's AdSense. Since you have 0 control over what companies do with your data, or how carefully they store it, it is inevitable that your data will be leaked at some point which is why this guide will serve primarily as a set of best practices for using the internet as privately as possible.&nbsp;</p>

                    Step 1: Damage Control and Password Management</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">You should start by checking&nbsp;<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a> to see what of yours is out there. From there obviously change any passwords that have been leaked.&nbsp;<a href="https://monitor.firefox.com/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://monitor.firefox.com/</a> is also another good site for this.&nbsp;Keep in mind THIS IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE. It is only a good starting place. The only way to guarantee password security is to use a secure password manager which houses unique and complex passwords for all of your accounts. Personally, I use <a href="https://keepass.info/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">KeePass</a>, an open source, locally hosted password manager. This is the most secure, though it is not the most convenient since it does not allow for cloud based password management without extra development. If you are in the market for a cloud based service though, I would recommend Dashlane. See their white paper <a href="assets/files/dashwhitepaper.pdf" class="text-primary">here</a>. I don't recommend them because they are "good", in fact they have actually experienced data leaks several times in the past. I only recommend them because as of right now, they seem to have adapted the most from their previous insecure state. One of the main mantras of online privacy is to never rely too heavily on any single tool. If you do end up using a cloud based password manager it is critical to make sure you frequently check to make sure they haven't had any security breaches.</p>

                    Step 2: Determine How Much Effort You Want To Put In</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Privacy is a collection of habits. The amount of privacy you enjoy is directly proportional to the amount of time you spend ensuring it exists. This guide will only explicitly cover measures that I believe all people should have in place, though its important to remember that the less data you make available, the less motivated companies are to care about you. What I mean is that if a service is free, you are the product. Therefore if you aren't a valuable product, some companies won't deem your business worth the server space and will go as far as to deny service. <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Here</a> is a resource that I consider to be an entire testament in the online privacy bible. Take some time to browse the site to see how far you want to go. The things that follow in this guide however will not result in any impedance to your normal activities.</p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">
                    Step 3: First Steps In Privacy</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">As I said above, privacy is not a product, its a way of operating; so with that in mind lets go through the first actions to take.&nbsp;<br><br>Exercise&nbsp;stricter control over the data you give out - Seems like a no brainer, but here are a few things to get the most privacy for the least action.<br><br>1) Use a separate email for your subscriptions. A good rule of thumb is that if the email is not being sent by a human, then it does not need to go to you personal inbox. Once done you can sign up for things as you please knowing you will never have to sort through the spam to find an important email.<br><br>2) Clear cookies often. <a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/privacy/what-are-cookies" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Cookies</a> are small pieces of code that are stored on your computer. This code is repeatedly executed as you use your browser which prompts them to record information about your online behavior. As you access various websites around the internet, the website you visit interact with these cookies to figure out who you are and where you have been and what you were doing before visiting. There is a lot more behind the scenes but that is the gist. The bottom line is that is is virtually impossible to operate completely without cookies. This is because a small percentage of cookies are crucial to site function which is the excuse that companies use to continue forcing you to fork over your data, so I will quickly run through my browser setup which uses minimal cookies. Firstly, I use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Firefox</a> and so should you. It can do everything chrome/edge can except its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" class="text-primary" target="_blank">open source</a>&nbsp;meaning that security vulnerabilities are caught much quicker, and there is total transparency. Anyways, In Firefox its as simple as navigating to the privacy settings and setting the browser privacy mode to strict which will block a lot of greedy cookies. Then scroll down a little further and turn on permanent private browsing. This will ensure that your cookies are cleared every time the browser is closed which is key. This means that while using the browser, online service will still get off on watching your every move, but by clearing the cookies every time you finish, you basically block them from following you home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>3) Control your phone number. This is the most valuable piece of information that you are constantly forced to give out. The only way to circumvent this is to use a separate phone line to sign up for things which can be as cheap as $15/month. This again allows you to sign up for things as you wish with no risk for spam since the phone will be off unless it is actively being used to verify. This brings me back to my previous point about choosing how far to go. This is unnecessary for most, but is an example to use for discussing the need to balance what you want with the effort you are willing to put it. You should however be very hesitant to hand out your phone number to anyone since nowadays active mobile number cost more to buy than social security numbers.<br><br>4) Just lie - How many times have you filled out an information form only to realize that, the destination behind the form did not have what you were looking for? Well the person who received that filled out form is still going to sell your data, in fact, they will likely seek you out to send you advertisement to try and lure you back in. This is why you instead use an alias. It can even be fun. When prompted to enter information (especially for free or prospective services), you should use an alias which has its own email and name. This will work to stop your data from getting onto insecure servers in the first place.<br><br> Realistically the only reason someone would <em>need </em>your personal data is if they are required by law to collect it which - contrary to what many terms of service will tell you if you read the fine print (yes terms of service frequently lie) - is only in very specific circumstances. If you live in the US, you would only fall under this obligation when dealing with an internet service or telecommunications provider, banking service, or healthcare service. Other than those circumstances, there is rarely a justifiable reason for a company to retain accurate information about you.<br><br>5)&nbsp;Secure Email Provider - Nearly all email providers, namely Microsoft and Google claim to not scan your inbox... which is technically true. They instead just scan everything before it gets into the inbox. They claim that their scans are only to detect things such as malware, though since they use proprietary software, it is impossible to know and there is no law that requires them to be honest. Unless you live in Europe thus under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it is best to use a more secure, privacy oriented email provider. The best in my opinion is Proton, which I personally use. They're service is free though you can rest assured knowing that you benefit from end-to-end encryption which means they could not access their data if they tried.<br><br>That's it! These few things, while fairly small will do wonders for keeping your data more secure. As you have likely been able to tell, a lot of this is just manual obfuscation of data; ie. your data in most circumstances is still being collected, only with these measures, it is much more difficult to connect that data to your real name, phone, address, friends, colleagues, family, habits, dreams, and aspirations which is ultimately the goal of data aggregation. If you are still asking if data collection is even that bad, I will remind you that the companies themselves to not have malicious intents, they are merely greedy. It is instead the cyber criminals who frequently gain access to corporate databases who will use your data maliciously. This is the reason for taking the steps laid out above. Every single company claims to store data securely, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches" class="text-primary" target="_blank">see for yourself that this is not the case.</a><br><br><br></p>
